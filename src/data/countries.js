      what: 'Russia\'s full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022, continues into its fourth year as the largest military conflict in Europe since WWII. Both sides have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties. Russia occupies approximately 18% of Ukraine\'s internationally recognized territory—Crimea since 2014 (illegally annexed) and parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts since the 2022 full-scale invasion. Active peace negotiations are now underway—Geneva talks in February 2026 ended without a deal—deep divisions persist on territorial questions. A multi-tiered ceasefire plan was proposed with Western support, and France and the UK have pledged to install military hubs in Ukraine. US-Russia talks in Abu Dhabi re-established military dialogue. However, territorial disputes remain the core sticking point, with Russia demanding full control of Donetsk and Luhansk.',
      why: 'This conflict has fundamentally reshaped European security architecture and revitalized NATO. The outcome will define the international order for decades: whether territorial conquest through military force remains viable. Peace negotiations are the most significant diplomatic development since the war began, driven by Trump administration pressure and battlefield exhaustion on both sides.',
      next: 'Active peace talks create the first real possibility of a ceasefire since the war began. Watch for: Geneva negotiation progress, territorial compromise formulas, security guarantee framework, and whether both sides accept monitoring mechanisms. Key variables: Trump\'s diplomatic leverage, Putin\'s territorial demands, Zelenskyy\'s red lines, and European security commitments.'

      what: 'Russia continues its war in Ukraine while engaging in trilateral peace negotiations with the US and Ukraine. Geneva talks in February 2026 showed progress on military tracks but Russia demands Ukrainian withdrawal from Donbas as a precondition—a non-starter for Kyiv. The country faces unprecedented Western sanctions—over 16,000 measures—but has adapted through shadow fleet oil sales and trade rerouting via China and India. The war economy consumes 40% of the budget. Military casualties are estimated at 300,000+ killed and wounded. Domestically, Putin has consolidated total authoritarian control.',
      why: 'Russia possesses the world\'s largest nuclear arsenal and a permanent UN Security Council seat. The invasion has shattered the post-Cold War European security order. Russia\'s partnership with China, Iran, and North Korea forms a growing axis challenging Western hegemony. The peace negotiations represent the first serious diplomatic opening since the war began.',
      next: 'Russia is negotiating from a position of territorial control but economic strain. Watch for: negotiation posture, territorial demands, sanctions pressure, military-economic sustainability, and whether Putin accepts a ceasefire that falls short of his maximalist demands. The outcome will reshape global power dynamics for decades.'

A second ceasefire took effect October 2025, with Phase 2 beginning January 2026. However, violations are extensive—1,193+ Israeli violations documented since October, with nearly 500 Palestinians killed despite the ceasefire. Only 43% of allocated aid trucks are entering Gaza. The last Israeli hostage body was recovered in January 2026. In the West Bank, the PA governs limited areas in Israeli-controlled territory while 700,000+ settlers expand into disputed land. Post-war Gaza governance remains unresolved.',
      why: 'The Gaza war and ceasefire process have reshaped Middle East geopolitics. Hezbollah was significantly weakened by Israel\'s military operations. The humanitarian catastrophe has inflamed global opinion and strained US relations with allies. Palestinian statehood recognition has gained momentum internationally. The ceasefire\'s fragility threatens a return to full-scale conflict.',
      next: 'Phase 2 negotiations will determine long-term outcomes. Watch for: ceasefire compliance, Gaza reconstruction and governance, humanitarian access, West Bank settler violence, and international recognition moves.

Fighting has devastated Khartoum and spread across the country, particularly in Darfur where the RSF has captured all five state capitals including El Fasher. An estimated 400,000+ people have been killed and 13.6 million displaced—the world\'s largest displacement crisis. Mass killings, sexual violence, and ethnic cleansing have been documented. Famine conditions are spreading with hospitals non-functional.',
      why: 'Sudan\'s collapse threatens to destabilize the entire Horn of Africa and Sahel region. The RSF has links to Wagner Group/Russia and receives UAE support, while SAF has Egyptian and Iranian backing—making this a proxy battlefield. Sudan controls strategic Red Sea coastline and Nile water resources critical to Egypt. The humanitarian catastrophe rivals Yemen and Gaza in severity but receives far less attention.',
      next: 'Neither side appears capable of decisive military victory, suggesting prolonged conflict. The country may fragment into competing zones of control.

The military junta controls only ~21% of Myanmar\'s territory, with resistance forces holding ~42% and continue advancing toward the Bamar heartland. The military held sham elections from December 2025 to January 2026 in only 263 of 330 townships, widely boycotted and marked by intense violence. The March 2025 earthquake (magnitude 7.7) killed 5,000+ and compounded the crisis. Over 5.2 million people are displaced. The junta has responded with airstrikes on civilians, village burnings, and mass executions. The economy has collapsed.',
      why: 'Myanmar\'s instability creates refugee flows into Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. The country is a major corridor for drug trafficking. China has significant interests and influence over ethnic armies. The resistance lacks unified political leadership, and public exhaustion is growing. International attention has waned except from China. The conflict economy dominates.',

The conflict has killed 150,000-377,000 and created the world\'s worst humanitarian crisis — 21 million need aid. The $21B economy has collapsed. Houthis control Sanaa and most of the populated north. In 2024-2025, Houthis attacked Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Gaza, forcing the largest trade rerouting since Suez. The May 2025 US-Houthi ceasefire is now void after US-Israeli strikes on Iran in February 2026.',
      why: 'Yemen controls the Bab el-Mandeb strait through which 12% of global trade passes. Houthi anti-ship missiles and drones can shut down Red Sea shipping, as proven in 2024. Combined with Iran\'s Hormuz threat, this creates an unprecedented dual chokepoint crisis. Yemen is the epicenter of Saudi-Iranian proxy conflict. The humanitarian catastrophe (UN projects 1.3M dead by 2030 if war continues) represents a moral and strategic crisis. US naval assets in the region are potential targets.',
      next: 'Watch for: Houthi resumption of Red Sea shipping attacks (expected imminently), ballistic missile strikes toward Israel, US preemptive strikes on Houthi positions, Saudi-Houthi peace process collapse, humanitarian access disruptions, and dual Hormuz/Red Sea blockade impact on global energy markets. The intersection of proxy war, shipping chokepoint, and famine makes Yemen uniquely consequential.'

      what: 'Haiti has collapsed into gang rule following the 2021 assassination of President Moïse. Armed gangs now control 90% of Port-au-Prince, the capital. Gang violence has killed thousands and displaced over 1.4 million people. The state has effectively ceased to function—hospitals are closed, schools shuttered, and police overwhelmed. The Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission largely failed. In October 2025, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2793, creating the Gang Suppression Force (GSF)—a 5,500-strong UN-backed force mandated to conduct independent counter-gang operations. The GSF is set to replace the MSS between March-April 2026.',
      why: 'Haiti\'s collapse creates migration pressure toward the US, Dominican Republic, and Caribbean nations. It demonstrates how quickly state failure can occur. The country is a transit point for drug trafficking. International intervention efforts have repeatedly failed, raising questions about effective responses to fragile states. Regional stability in the Caribbean is affected.',
      next: 'The Gang Suppression Force must succeed where the MSS failed. With 5,500 troops and a stronger mandate, it has better prospects but faces well-armed gangs controlling 90% of the capital. Watch for: GSF deployment effectiveness, gang coordination, migration flows, and humanitarian access. Long-term recovery requires dismantling gang networks and rebuilding institutions from scratch—a generational project.'

In February 2026, Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab Lil Haq — airstrikes on Kabul, Kandahar, and border areas — after escalating TTP cross-border violence, marking the first inter-state war between the two neighbors.',

Over a year later, M23 still occupies both cities, causing a severe humanitarian crisis—over 1 million Goma residents face economic collapse, bank closures, and cash shortages. The Doha Framework Agreement was signed in November 2025, and a ceasefire monitoring mechanism was agreed to on February 2, 2026. The DRC and Rwanda also signed the Washington Agreements in December 2025. Despite diplomatic momentum, fighting continues in some areas. The EU announced $95.8 million in humanitarian aid in February 2026.',
      why: 'DRC holds vast mineral wealth critical to global technology—cobalt for batteries, coltan for electronics, gold, and diamonds. M23\'s control of major cities represents the most significant rebel territorial gains in decades. Rwanda\'s involvement has been extensively documented despite denials. The humanitarian crisis is among the world\'s worst with 7+ million displaced.',

      what: 'Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was confirmed killed in US-Israeli strikes on February 28, 2026, along with 40+ senior officials. Over 2,000 strikes have hit targets across 24 of 31 provinces since Feb 28. The death toll has surpassed 787 (Al Jazeera) with HRANA estimating 1,190+ killed and 4,475 injured. A strike on a girls\' school in Minab killed 148+ students. An Interim Leadership Council (Pezeshkian, Mohseni-Ejei, Ayatollah Arafi) has assumed power per Article 111. Iran launched "Operation True Promise IV" — retaliatory strikes across 9 countries including a ballistic missile that hit a synagogue shelter in Beit Shemesh, Israel, killing 9 including 3 children. 6 US service members have been killed. The IRGC declared the Strait of Hormuz closed on March 2. On March 3, the IDF destroyed the Natanz nuclear facility and a covert nuclear site "Minzadehei." US-Israel have achieved air superiority over Tehran.',
      why: 'The assassination of Iran\'s Supreme Leader is the most consequential targeted killing since Osama bin Laden. Khamenei held absolute authority over Iran\'s military, nuclear program, and proxy network for 35 years. His death creates a succession crisis during active war. The Strait of Hormuz is effectively closed with tanker traffic at near zero — Brent crude spiked to $84/barrel with analysts warning of $120-200 if sustained. Iranian proxies have activated: Hezbollah resumed hostilities from Lebanon (first since Nov 2024 ceasefire), Iraqi Shia militias launched 23+ drone strikes on US assets, and Houthis are preparing retaliatory strikes. Iran attacked targets across 8+ Arab states including the US embassy in Riyadh.',
      next: 'The conflict is escalating across multiple fronts. Trump stated the war could last 4-5 weeks. Rubio warns "hardest hits yet to come." Watch for: Strait of Hormuz enforcement, Interim Leadership Council consolidation and Supreme Leader succession (Assembly of Experts convening), further Iranian missile salvos, Hezbollah escalation from Lebanon, Houthi Red Sea attacks, Iraqi militia strikes, and dual Hormuz/Red Sea blockade scenario. IAEA confirmed Natanz damage but no radiological release. FM Araghchi signals openness to de-escalation while security chief Larijani rejects negotiations.'

Kim Jong Un oversaw hypersonic missile tests, citing "geopolitical crisis." The nuclear arsenal is estimated at 50+ warheads and growing. Kim Jong Un has declared South Korea a "hostile state" and abandoned reunification as a goal. Military cooperation with Russia has deepened, with North Korea providing ammunition for the Ukraine war in exchange for qualitative military modernization. North Korea is maintaining a non-antagonistic stance toward the US to keep the door open for a Trump summit, suppressing major provocations until after the April 2026 Trump-Xi summit. The population faces chronic food insecurity under strict totalitarian control.',
      why: 'North Korea\'s nuclear weapons threaten South Korea, Japan, and potentially the US. Proliferation risk is high—Pyongyang has sold missile technology to Iran and others. Military miscalculation could trigger catastrophic war on the Korean Peninsula. The regime\'s brutality makes it among the world\'s worst human rights situations.

A provisional constitution was ratified establishing a 5-year transition period (2025-2030). The interim government is working to establish authority but faces enormous challenges: the northeast remains under Kurdish-led SDF control with US military presence, sectarian tensions persist, and ISIS exploits instability. Since January 2026, the Syrian army has been conducting a large-scale offensive against Kurdish SDF forces in the northeast. Over 1.2 million Syrians have returned from abroad and 2 million internally displaced have returned. The economy is devastated and over half the pre-war population remains displaced.',
      why: 'Syria\'s transition from Assad\'s authoritarian rule is one of the most significant geopolitical shifts in the Middle East in decades. Russia lost its key Arab ally and Mediterranean military bases. Iran\'s "land bridge" to Hezbollah was severed. The outcome will determine whether Syria becomes a functioning state or fragments further. Reconstruction will require massive international investment. Millions of refugees may begin returning if stability holds.',

On March 3, Israel struck Beirut and Tehran simultaneously, hitting targets across southern Beirut. Israel is mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists near the Lebanese border. Lebanese PM Nawaf Salam convened an emergency cabinet and demanded Hezbollah surrender weapons and cease all militia military activity — one of the harshest government stances ever against the group. An Israeli ground incursion into southern Lebanon is reported underway.',
      why: 'Lebanon has been dragged into the Iran-Israel war despite being a country already in economic collapse. Hezbollah, though "a shadow of the force it once was" after 2024 degradation (CNN analysis), still possesses precision-guided munitions capable of striking Tel Aviv. An Israeli ground invasion would devastate southern Lebanon for the third time in two decades. The PM\'s ban on Hezbollah military activities signals a historic internal political shift — asserting that "decisions on war and peace rest exclusively with the state" — but is largely unenforceable. The civilian population is caught between Hezbollah\'s Iranian obligations and Israeli military power.',

Tourism now dominates the economy. Hurricane Ivan (2004) destroyed 90% of structures. Grenada is active in the OECS and CARICOM. The country has developed a successful sustainable tourism model focused on agro-tourism and heritage. Cocoa production is undergoing a quality revolution with high-end chocolate brands.', why: 'Grenada\'s spice industry is globally significant — nutmeg supply disruptions from Hurricane Ivan caused global price spikes. The 1983 invasion was a pivotal Cold War event that shaped US Caribbean policy. The cocoa-to-chocolate value chain development is a model for Caribbean agricultural upgrading. Climate vulnerability threatens both agriculture and tourism.', next: 'Watch for: spice industry resilience and diversification, premium chocolate export growth, tourism sustainability initiatives, and hurricane preparedness given the devastating precedent of Ivan.' } },

Diamond mining and garment manufacturing provide additional revenue. The country has one of the world\'s highest HIV prevalence rates (over 20%). Political instability has included multiple coups and a 1998 South African military intervention. A national reform process aims to restructure governance.', why: 'Lesotho\'s water exports are critical for South Africa\'s economic heartland — disruption would affect the continent\'s largest economy. The country\'s complete geographic encirclement by South Africa creates near-total dependence on its neighbor for trade, energy, and transport.

The $7B economy is driven by advanced manufacturing (dental products, precision instruments), financial services managing $300B+ in assets, and a customs union with Switzerland. The country reformed its banking sector after a 2008 tax evasion scandal involving Germany. Liechtenstein is an EEA member but not in the EU, giving it single market access. The Hilti Group (power tools) and Ivoclar (dental) are major employers.', why: 'Liechtenstein\'s financial sector manages assets worth 40x its GDP, making it systemically significant despite its size. The principality\'s strong monarchy model contrasts with Europe\'s ceremonial monarchies — voters rejected curtailing the prince\'s powers in 2012. Its manufacturing density and innovation punch far above its weight.

Monaco is expanding territory through a $2.4B land reclamation project (Mareterra/Portier Cove). The Principality is a member of the Council of Europe but not the EU, with a customs union with France. Financial transparency has improved under international pressure.', why: 'Monaco\'s tax policies affect European fiscal sovereignty debates — France and Italy lose revenue from wealthy residents relocating. Prince Albert\'s ocean conservation diplomacy gives the microstate outsized environmental influence. The Mareterra land reclamation project pushes engineering limits and addresses the fundamental constraint of no buildable land.

The country was notably one of the first in Europe to vaccinate its population using Russia\'s Sputnik V vaccine. San Marino has sought EU association agreements to access the single market. The country has no military, with Italy providing defense. Tax reforms have modernized what was once considered a haven.', why: 'San Marino\'s ancient republican government is a unique political model studied by constitutional scholars. Its EU association negotiations could create a template for European microstates. The Sputnik V vaccine decision demonstrated how small states can make independent foreign policy choices.

Offshore oil exploration in a Joint Development Zone with Nigeria has not yet produced commercial quantities. Cocoa was historically the main export but production has declined. The country is a stable democracy by regional standards. Portugal, the former colonial power, remains the primary development partner. Chinese fishing agreements and infrastructure deals are growing. The islands\' strategic position in the Gulf of Guinea gives outsized maritime significance.', why: 'Sao Tome\'s Gulf of Guinea position is strategically relevant as piracy and maritime insecurity grow in the region. Potential oil reserves in the Nigeria JDZ could transform the economy (or create resource curse dynamics). The country is a test case for whether small African democracies can manage oil wealth better than their larger neighbors. Chinese interest in Gulf of Guinea access points is a growing geopolitical factor.', next: 'Watch for: oil exploration results in the Nigeria JDZ, Gulf of Guinea maritime security developments, Chinese infrastructure investment expansion, and whether democratic governance can be maintained through an oil transition.' } },

This program generates significant revenue but has attracted scrutiny over due diligence failures and money laundering risks. The sugar industry, which defined the economy for 300 years, was shut down in 2005. Tourism now dominates. Nevis periodically threatens secession from the federation. The Brimstone Hill Fortress is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.', why: 'Saint Kitts\' CBI program became the global model — dozens of countries now offer similar schemes. However, the passport has been linked to sanctions evasion and financial crime, leading to periodic EU visa-free access threats. The Nevis secession movement raises questions about micro-federation viability.

The banana industry, once the economic backbone, collapsed after the EU removed preferential trade terms. Two Nobel laureates (Arthur Lewis, economics; Derek Walcott, literature) give the island the highest per-capita Nobel rate in the world. The country also operates a citizenship-by-investment program. Climate change, hurricanes, and volcanic risk (Soufrière is active) pose existential threats. Youth unemployment exceeds 30%.', why: 'Saint Lucia\'s tourism-dependent economy demonstrates the vulnerability of Caribbean small island states to external shocks (COVID devastated the sector). The banana trade collapse showed how EU trade policy changes can destroy small-state economies overnight. Its CBI program competes with regional peers for investment dollars.

PM Ralph Gonsalves, the longest-serving Caribbean leader (since 2001), has been a vocal advocate for climate reparations and maintains close ties with Cuba and Venezuela. The Grenadines (including Mustique and Bequia) attract luxury tourism. Agriculture (bananas, arrowroot) and fishing are important on the main island. The country has been active in international forums championing small island state rights.', why: 'The La Soufrière eruption highlighted the extreme vulnerability of small island states to natural disasters — recovery costs exceeded annual GDP. Gonsalves\' climate reparations advocacy has gained traction in international climate negotiations. The Grenadines\' luxury tourism market serves a different niche than most Caribbean economies. SVG\'s diplomatic independence (maintaining Cuba/Venezuela ties) shows small states can chart autonomous foreign policy.', next: 'Watch for: continued volcanic recovery and rebuilding, climate reparations campaign progress, Gonsalves\' eventual succession, and the Grenadines tourism sector as a buffer against mainland agricultural volatility.' } }
